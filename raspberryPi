Needed:

    Raspberry pi
    Micro SD Card (flashed with Raspbian Buster with desktop)
    5V, 2.5A power supply
    HDMI cable
    HDMI monitor and power cable
    keyboard/mouse
    Breadboard
    1x LED
    1x 330 ohm resistor
    2x female-to-male wires

Perform the following steps using a Raspberry pi:

    Insert SD card, connect keyboard/mouse, connect hdmi cable from pi to monitor, connect monitor power cable
    Plug in pi power supply last
    Log into the pi desktop environment
    Make sure its connected to titan-share
    Open terminal and type 'ifconfig' to find the IP address of the pi
        This is the wlan0 inet address i.e. 192.168.1.15

Perform the following steps on another computer that has terminal and is connected to titan-share:

For the following IP addresses, substitute 15 for the number obtained from ifconfig

    In terminal enter ping 192.168.1.15 to make sure you are successfully reaching it
        Enter ctrl + c to stop
    Create a new file named gpio.py in a text editor and copy/type the attached code into the file (use 4 spaces for indentation, NOT tabs)
        To use nano enter nano gpio.py
        Save the file and note the location
    Use scp to transfer the file to the pi
        Make sure you are in the same directory as the gpio.py file in terminal
        Enter scp gpio.py pi@192.168.1.15:/home/pi/Documents
    Connect to the pi using ssh
        In terminal enter: ssh pi@192.168.1.15
            ssh is a protocol
            pi is the user
            192.168.1.15 is the host
        cd into the Documents directory (use commands: ls, pwd, cd)
        Enter ls to view the contents of Documents and verify gpio.py is there

Wiring the Raspberry pi and breadboard:

    To view a GPIO diagram in greater detail: type pinout in terminal
    Use the attached schematic as reference to set up the circuit
        Plug in the LED
            longer leg = positive (power), shorter leg = negative (ground)
        Plug in the resistor
        Plug in ground wire
        Plug in GPIO (power) wire

Running the script:

    Return to the remote ssh session and type python gpio.py
    Interact with the program and test the light
    Enter ctrl + c to stop
    Edit the pi file again by typing nano gpio.py in the terminal and add the following functionality:
        Now instead of the light turning off for 4 seconds when you type rover, make it blink (on/off) using a loop (loop can be any arbitrary number of iterations i.e. 20)
            HINT: research python loops if you're unfamiliar with them and use the code already written in gpio.py to complete this

To power off the pi:

    Use the pi desktop or enter sudo init 0 from either the pi desktop terminal or remote ssh terminal session (may ask for password again)
    Once the green light stops blinking on the pi, you may disconnect power
